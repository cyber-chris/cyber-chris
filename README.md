### Hello there! :wave:

I have a [personal website](https://cyberchris.xyz/), where I occasionally post writings. You can find my CV [here](https://cv.cyberchris.xyz/).

My old account was [@thevirtuoso1973](https://github.com/thevirtuoso1973), which may be of interest for its git/contribution history.
